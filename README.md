# Sounce
“Sounce” is an application that will help people with limited hearing and speaking abilities to communicate easier in society.

## Current status
Initially, it was a project on AI hackathon which we won. 

Now, with the support of the Synergy Science Park, we are developing our project and preparing an application for UNICEF. We are looking for partners and financing for development of this project. 

## How it works?
You are taking a video of a person’s gestures, and in real time you are provided with a translation from the language of the deaf and dumb. You can also enter the words you want to reproduce, and “Sounce” will provide the result in pictures or video sequences describing the desired information. 

The main function of this application is translation from the language of the deaf-and-dumb into English, or vice versa (in the future it is planned to expand the set of provided languages, both sign and verbal).
