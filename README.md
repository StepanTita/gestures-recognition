# Sounce
“Sounce” is an application that will help people with limited hearing and speaking abilities to communicate easier in society. 
### How it works?
You are taking a video of a person’s gestures, and in real time you are provided with a translation from the language of the deaf and dumb. You can also enter the words you want to reproduce, and “Sounce” will provide the result in pictures or video sequences describing the desired information. 

The main functions of this application are translation from the language of the deaf-and-dumb into English, or vice versa (in the future it is planned to expand the set of provided languages, both sign and verbal). The main users of this application are the staff of various institutions of the service sector. In our opinion, it is necessary to begin the implementation of the proposed technology first in public places, warning that video is being filmed. This will reduce the risk of negative perception of the application and the motives that are pursued.
