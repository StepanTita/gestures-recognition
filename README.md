# Sounce: Bridging Communication Gaps for the Hearing and Speech Impaired 🌟

Welcome to the Sounce GitHub repository, an innovative application designed to empower individuals with limited hearing and speaking abilities to communicate effectively in society. 🗣️👂📱

## Current Status 🚀

Originally conceived during an AI hackathon, Sounce emerged victorious. Today, with the generous support of the Synergy Science Park, we are actively developing our project and preparing to collaborate with UNICEF. We are on the lookout for partners and financial backing to further our mission. 💼💰

## How It Works 🤖

Sounce leverages cutting-edge technology to bridge communication gaps. Here's how it operates:

1. **Gesture-Based Translation**: Record a video of a person's gestures, and in real-time, receive translations from sign language to text or speech. 📹✋🔤

2. **Text Input**: Alternatively, you can input text, and Sounce will provide visual or audio representations of the desired information. 📝🔊🖼️

The primary function of Sounce is to facilitate translation between sign language and English, with future plans to expand the range of supported languages, both sign and verbal. 🌐🗨️
